<h1>Basic Button Events</h1>
<h4 style="color:blue;font-style:italic;">Learning about buttons and events</h4>

<blockquote style="background-color:aquamarine">
    This page will demonstrate the basics of button events. It will use a &lt;input&gt; control
    to ask for some user input. It will use a &lt;button&gt; control to process the input.
    It will demonstrate basic use of C# code to do the processing.

<!-- The component page has 2 environments: html and C#
    The current environment is dictated by the code that is executing
    You switch between environments by use of the "at" symbol
    The "at" symbol switching your environment to C#
    Any html code that is executed automatically returns you to the default enviromnment of Html

    the WelcomeMsg in the following paragraph is in the C# environment and is a variable.
-->
<p>@WelcomeMsg</p>

<!--
    the onclick parameter value is a method name in your C# code
    when the button is pressed by the user; the action is sent to the server via SignalR;
    the server starts to process the page; the event is excuted after the setup by the server
    of the page; after the action the page is re-rendered and returned to the browser as html
